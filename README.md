# ðŸŽ¬ Media Server - Gin/Go

A lightweight media file server written in Go using the Gin web framework.  
Supports browsing, uploading, downloading media files, and generating thumbnails & subtitles (if any) via `ffmpeg`.

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Install Go dependencies

```bash
go mod init media-server
go mod tidy
```

### 2. Install ffmpeg (for thumbnail generation)

```bash
# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# On Mac
brew install ffmpeg

# On Windows, download ffmpeg from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
```

### 3. Run the server

```bash
go run main.go
```

#### For dockerized builds:

```bash
docker build -t <your_dockerhub_username>/media-server:latest .
docker run -p 8080:8080 <your_dockerhub_username>/media-server:latest

# docker logs <container_id>
# docker stop <container_id>
```
